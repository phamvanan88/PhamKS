DIY HomeKit Sensor with ESP32 â€“ Create a Smart Temperature &amp; Humidity Sensor for iPhone Apple Home"
Build Your Own HomeKit Temperature & Humidity Sensor Using ESP32!

In this video, Iâ€™ll show you how to create a smart sensor using an ESP32 microcontroller and a DHT22 (or BME280) sensor. Weâ€™ll walk through how to wire it, program it using the HomeSpan library, and pair it directly with Apple HomeKit â€” no hub or bridge required.

Youâ€™ll be able to monitor temperature and humidity directly from the Apple Home app on your iPhone or iPad and even create automations like turning on a fan/aircon when it gets too hot in the next project.

âœ… Perfect for beginners in smart home DIY or anyone who loves ESP32 + Apple ecosystems.

ðŸ”§ What Youâ€™ll Learn:
What hardware you need
Wiring the sensor
Installing HomeSpan on ESP32
Uploading code and pairing with HomeKit
Viewing real-time sensor data on your iPhone

ðŸ“¦ Hardware Used:
ESP32 board (e.g. ESP32-S3, WROOM, or similar)
DHT22 or BMP/BME280 sensor
Breadboard, jumper wires
