DIY HomeKit Sensor with ESP32 – Create a Smart Temperature &amp; Humidity Sensor for iPhone Apple Home"
Build Your Own HomeKit Temperature & Humidity Sensor Using ESP32!

In this video, I’ll show you how to create a smart sensor using an ESP32 microcontroller and a DHT22 (or BME280) sensor. We’ll walk through how to wire it, program it using the HomeSpan library, and pair it directly with Apple HomeKit — no hub or bridge required.

You’ll be able to monitor temperature and humidity directly from the Apple Home app on your iPhone or iPad and even create automations like turning on a fan/aircon when it gets too hot in the next project.

✅ Perfect for beginners in smart home DIY or anyone who loves ESP32 + Apple ecosystems.

🔧 What You’ll Learn:
What hardware you need
Wiring the sensor
Installing HomeSpan on ESP32
Uploading code and pairing with HomeKit
Viewing real-time sensor data on your iPhone

📦 Hardware Used:

ESP32 board (e.g. ESP32-S3, WROOM, or similar)

DHT22 or BME280 sensor

Breadboard, jumper wires
